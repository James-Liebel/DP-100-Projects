    "# Clustering - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to *supervised* machine learning, *unsupervised* learning is used when there is no \"ground truth\" from which to train and validate label predictions. The most common form of unsupervised learning is *clustering*, which is similar conceptually to *classification*, except that the training data does not include known values for the class label to be predicted. Clustering works by separating the training cases based on similarities that can be determined from their feature values. The numeric features of a given entity can be thought of as vector coordinates that define the entity's position in n-dimensional space. What a clustering model seeks to do is to identify groups, or *clusters*, of entities that are close to one another while being separated from other clusters.\n",

    "1. Download [seeds.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ml-basics/refs/heads/main/Labfiles/data/seeds.csv){:target=\"_blank\"} in a new browser tab, and save it on your local disk.\n",
    "2. Then use the **Upload Data** button at the top of this notebook to upload it.\n",
    "3. Run the next cell by clicking the **▶️ Run** button to load the data.\n",
